# Pandas-challenge

The project is to create a Python script to analyse the area-wide standardised test results. These results will be used to help the school board and mayor make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities.The Python script will merge the two data sets to analyse the results correlating the student results to school budgets and priorities.
Improving the readability of the data frames which includes formatting and reorganising the information is the next step of improving this project.

Table of Contents

In the folder PyCitySchools, you will find the python script PyCitySchools.py. This is the main script which provides the statistics and all the analysis for the schools in the city.
In the Resources folder, you will find two csv files which the main script referes to pull out the data to analyse.
Written analysis document includes the final tables produced by the data and the analysis. It also contains two conclusions in bold text.
